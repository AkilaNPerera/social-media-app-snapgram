-----Packages------
To manage routes - react-router-dom

-----Tips------
1. rafce - Creates a component within the file

-----Points to remember------
1. In App.tsx, couldn't import the globals.css file. Therefore, globals.d.ts file was created to make the css files available globally.
2. Shadcn can override the globals.css and tailwind.config.js files.
3. .env.local allows to add variables that are specific to your local computer.

-----Libraries------
q. shadcn - allows to customize pre-designed components with tailwind. (Can only add the components we need. These fall under the components folder)

-----Issues-----
1. In sign up form the logo and the submit button were cut out from the screen. The image wasn't fit to the screen to.
Therefore,
    - Added 'overflow-auto no-scrollbar' classes to fit the image to the screen and thereby hide the scrollbar that appeared
      next to the form.
    - Added 'flex items-center' to the first div tag to center the form elements.
    - Added 'mb-4' to the img tag to make the dissappeared logo appear.
2. Still the import.meta.env wasn't recognized. Therefore, had to add some configurations to tsconfig.json and 
tsconfig.app.json files
